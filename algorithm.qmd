The aSynPEP-DB collects natural peptides that can be found in humans. However, users might be interested in

i) Designing synthetic peptides fulfilling the described criteria.
ii) Evaluate non-listed natural peptides.

For these reasons, we have added the possibility of predicting such features with the complementary [aSynPEP discriminative algorithm](http://asynpep.ppmclab.com/).
