## Background
α-Synuclein aggregation is a key driver of neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s disease and related syndromes. Accordingly, obtaining a molecule that targets α-synuclein toxic assemblies with high affinity is a long-pursued objective. We exploited the biophysical properties of toxic oligomers and amyloid fibrils to identify a family of α-helical peptides that bind to these α-synuclein species with low nanomolar affinity, without interfering with the monomeric functional protein [[1]](references.html). We identified amphipaticyty, alpha-helical content and positive net charge as three key properties that these peptides share. This activity is translated into a high anti-aggregation potency and the ability to abrogate oligomer-induced cell damage. Using a structure-guided search we identified a human peptide (LL-37) expressed in the brain and the gastrointestinal tract with analogous binding, anti-aggregation, and detoxifying properties. We have recently hypothesized that endogenous amphipathic and cationic helical peptides like LL-37 might constitue a new therapeutic paradigm for specifically targeting toxic species in PD [[2]](references.html).

The aSynPEP database collects human endogenous peptides (neuropeptides, antimicrobial peptides and gut-microbiome derived peptides) which meet the described criteria, therefore having the potential to selectively bind alpha-synuclein toxic oligomers and inhibit its irreversible fibrilization.

## Discriminative algorithm

The aSynPEP-DB collects natural peptides that can be found in humans. However, users might be interested in designing synthetic peptides fulfilling the described criteria or testing alternative datasets. For this reason, we have added the possibility of predicting such features with the complementary [aSynPEP descriminative algorithm](http://asynpep.ppmclab.com/).
