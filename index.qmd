## Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

**How are the peptides obtained?**

aSynPEP-DB is built from peptides which could be inherently interacting with α-Synuclein aggregated species in human populations. α-Synuclein aggregates are found in the brain of Parkinson's Disease patients in the form of Lewy bodies [[9278044]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9278044/). Recent studies suggest the initial amyloid conversion could be traced to the gastointestinal tract and transmitted to the brain [[31255487]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31255487/).

The aSynPEP-DB considers three independent peptide source datasets: human neuropeptides, gut-microbiome peptides from healthy humans and human antimicrobial peptides.
αSynPEP-DB rationalises that human peptides which prevent this pathogenic aggregation would be expressed in the nervous system.
Besides, gut-microbiota is known to alter human physiology through the gut-brain axis [[31460832]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31460832/). Growing preclinical evidence shows gut α-Synuclein can be transported to the brain via the vagus nerve [[31255487]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31255487/) and that the modulation of α-Synuclein by bacterial components such as LPS [[31460832]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31460832/) or extracellular peptides such as PSMα3 can modulate its aggregation [[34145261]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34145261/). Furthermore, we recently showed that the human anti-microbial peptide LL-37 targetted α-Synuclein toxic oligomers with nanomolar affinity [[34145261]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34145261/). All together, aSynPEP exploits datasets of peptides that could be present in the human brain or gut where aSyn aggregates occur in disease.

The knowledge obtained from PSMa3 and LL-37 allowed us to identify three physicochemical properties required for inhibition of aggregation: amphipathicyty, alpha-helical content and positive net charge [[34145261]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34145261/). This allowed us to screen peptide candidates from the three datasets of endogenous peptides with the potential to bind and inhibit α-Synuclein aggregation (Figure 1).

<span style="font-size: 13px;">**Figure 1.** The curation scheme shown above describes the bioinformatics pipeline developed starting with 5949 neuropeptides from NeuroPep [[25931458]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25931458/), 6105 AMPs provided by DRAMP [[34390348]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34390348/) and 2747 gut-microbiome species. Gut-microbiome species from GMrepo were considered when their abundance was >= 5% in healthy humans healthy [[34788838]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34788838/). Peptides were evauated on heuristic rules reflecting the experimentally reported requirements for amphipaticyty, alpha-helical propensity and overall positive charge.
Positive peptides were linked to external databases and enriched with therapeutic-relevant information.
Finally, positive peptides from different datasets were merged into aSynPEP-DB, rendering a total of 95 peptides with potential to inhibit pathogenic α-Synuclein aggregation.</span>


**Are the listed peptides experimentally validated?**

Our previous research identified amphipathicyty, alpha-helical content and positive net charge as the three key physicochemical propierties peptides need to have for high affinity binding to pathogenic oligomeric species of α-Synunclein. This identification allowed us to design two groups of synthtic peptides: those which met the aforementioned properties thus retaining their ability to bind and inhibit aggregation and those who did not. With this knowledge we develop αSynPEP-DB, a repository of endogenous peptides meeting such physicochemical requirements. 

Except the already mentioned LL-37, the peptides listed in the database are not experiemntally validated. We envision the aSynPEP-DB as a resource for researchers to identify and validate bioactive peptides that have the potential to inhibit α-Synuclein aggregation thus building a new therapeutic/diagnostic paradigm in different synucleopathies. Additionally, identifying human endogenous molecules that interact with aSyn aggregates may define new targets or biomarkers to monitor in patients.

**Is it possible to screen other peptides not considered by aSynPEP-DB?**

αSynPEP-DB provides information on peptides from human proteins and healthy human microbacterial populations under the premise that either these would have co-evolved to avoid or reduce toxic aggregated species of α-Synuclein in humans. To evaluate synthetic peptides or others not considered in the proposed pipeline, αSynPEP-DB provides a discriminative algorithm which screens for the three experimentally validated physicochemical properties identified for inhibitory peptides. This algorithm can be accessed in the [Algorithm](./algorithm.html) tab.
